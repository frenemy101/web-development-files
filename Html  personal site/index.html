  <h1> KAUSTAV CHAKRABORTY </h1> <br>
  type any tag name and press enter to get the entire syntax
  use a p tag to make the text that you are about to type in a paragraph form.
  <p><em>my name is kaustav CHAKRABORTY and im 19 years old and am learning web development from ground o despite knowing html</em><br>
    in order to make text italic, we dont use font anymore rather use the emphasis tag that puts emphasis on words like in web pages so just use the tag < em>
      <br>and get the result as above.<em>now we can replace em by i also and it will do the same job so i can use < i> <br>
          now we should use em instead of i because i tag only styles whereas em puts emphasis on the word</em>
      <br> <b> now b and strong does the same but we should use strong rather coz its about the structure and not the style </b></p>

  <h3> <strong>education</strong></h3>
  <p>aps pune <br>aps dk <br>aps lbs <br> aps kirkee <br>dypsoet <br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p> now if we do the same in the form of a list we will use <em><strong>unordered list</strong></em> which contains no specification of the points i.e. in the form of bullets and is written as < ul>
      and following list items are written in < li> tag
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>aps pune</li>
    <li>aps dk</li>
    <li>aps kbs</li>
    <li>aps kirkee</li>
    <li>dypsoet</li>
  </ul>
  <p>now all this can be done in <em><strong>ordered list</strong></em> that will give numbers or roman numerals</p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>aps pune</li>
    <li>aps dk</li>
    <li>aps lbs</li>
    <li>aps kirkee</li>
    <li>dypsoet</li> <br> <em><strong>#using the type attribute inside the ol tag i made the 1,2,3 numeric form to roman by simply setting it as < ol type="i "> *space to be ignored* . for plain default 1,2,3 simple < ol> shuould
            suffice</strong></em>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <li>aps pune</li>
    <li>aps dk</li>
    <li>aps lbs</li>
    <li>aps kirkee</li>now to write this sentence, br tag isnt necessary as li already puts the next statement/sentence in the next line because the tag doesnt contain this so the next sentence wud start from the next line but < br> wud add a bit
      more space in bw 2 lines... simple 1,2,3 be like...

  </ol>
  <hr>
  <p>so now in order to add images to the website what we can do is use the < img> tag in which the attribute src will be there which is used to define the source of the image
      be it from an online link or offline, the entire tag will be like < img src="xyz/abc.com " *space* alt=" the text to be displayed if the image cant be loaded from the server">
        <br> Now what happens with the alt attribute is that it helps oin the optimisation of web page and tells our host google that this is what the image is about as google cant literally "see" the image all by himself. </p>
  so here goes and example: <br> <img src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeSZZ4qF8vJyJeWYD1mkRyP_4O8SRoAMAhhaqc0/" alt=" farewell pic of mags and me on insta"> <br> <em><strong> now i needed to put br after the alt attribute text otherwise the alt text
      and the text i wrote next wud become 1 sentence</strong> </em>
  or instead of the link i can give the path directory of an image from my pc also.<br>
  the img didnt load because insta didnt give permission to download the image to be put up on my webpage
  so in order to get the image in, ill use a local reference i.e. <br>
  <img src="index mags and me collage.jpg" alt="a collage of mags and me on vid call ss, made on google photos"><br>
  and it came in the site though the size isnt what i expected but yeah i like it coz obviously i like to see maggie aache se. so voila!
  next will be adding secondary links to webpage and i hope aherf hasnt changed in html5 lol
  <hr><br>
  <p>in oder to add a link we will use < a> i.e. anchor tag with href attribute which will contain the link to the page we want to connect our webpage to</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>for instagram page of mine click....<em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/frenemy101/?hl=en">frenemy101</a></strong></em></li>
    <li>for mags' instagram page click .... <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_s.meghna/?hl=en">_s.meghna</a></strong></em></li>
  </ul>
  <br>click for my <a href="contact info.html">contact info</a><br>

  <h3><u>TABLES</u></h3>
  <table border="5" cellspacing="5">
    <thead>
      <th>column1</th>
      <th>column2</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>the th by default makes its content bold</td>
        <td> th is like tr but used for headings</td>
        <td>cyka blyat, so if u put in an extra cell, it wud look like this</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> td is table data</td>
        <td>tr is table row</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
      <tr>
        <td>footer cell 1</td>
        <td>footer cell 2</td>
      </tr>
    </tfoot>
  </table><em><strong>#footer doesnt makes anything special, just used for better structurising of out table.</strong></em>
  <br>the border attribute and the number associated gives the table a bit of diff thicness of externall wall,now adding borders isnt recommended as its out of date
   rather we can use css and javascript to make it look good later <br>
   now we can use the table's default no border no cellspacing feature and use it to put out profile pic on one td and out name and everything else in the adjacent td of the same tr <hr>
   <br>.....in order to insert emoji anywhere around a text suitable area, press windows+ . or windows + ; to get a emoji section pop up. CHEEKEY little trick.❤❤💋🐱‍🐉🐱‍👓🐱‍🚀🌹🎉😎🎶😢👀💖💖
